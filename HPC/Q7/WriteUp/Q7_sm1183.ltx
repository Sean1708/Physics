The program was written serially in \texttt{heatbath-serial.c}. This was timed using the bash
\texttt{time} built-in 10 times and the average was 10.0 seconds. The value of point (5.5, 5.5) once
the system had reached equilibrium was \(4.189211\).

The program was then parallelised in \texttt{heatbath-parallel.c}. This was also timed 10 times for
1, 2, 4, 5 and 10 processors and the averages are in table~\ref{t:parallel}. The same result
(\(4.189211\)) was achieved.
