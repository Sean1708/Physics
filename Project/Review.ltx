\section{Background}
The first known example of a ferroelectric material was Rochelle salt. Rochelle
salt was first grown in the 17\textsuperscript{th} Century by Elie
Seignette\cite{cro87} but it wasn't until 1880 that Pierre and Paul-Jacques
Curie showed that Rochelle salt displayed a non-linear electric response (more
specifically piezoelectricity, in which an applied strain induces a net
voltage).

Between 1921 and 1924 Joseph Valasek and his supervisor William Swann studied
Rochelle salt with a ballistic galvanometer as a dielectric material analogous
to ferromagnets, showing for the first time that a hysteresis can occur in
polarisation and coining the term ferroelectricity. They also showed that
ferroelectricity in Rochelle salt followed a Curie-Weiss law for its
permittivity and that there existed a Curie temperature (two Curie temperatures
in fact)\cite{val21,val22a,val22b,val24}. In 1929 CB Sawyer and CH Tower used
a linear capacitor connected to an oscilloscope to measure the first hysteresis
loop of a ferroelectric capacitor\cite{saw30}.

In 1945 V Ginsburg discovered ferroelectricity in barium titanate\cite{cro87}, a
perovskite structured crystal, and between the years of 1949 and 1960 another 20
perovskite structures were discovered. The origin of ferroelectricity in most
perovskites is fairly simple and based mostly on their structure (though there
are notable exceptions such as barium titanate)\cite{lin77}. Perovskites form a
face centred cubic structure with a body centred atom like the one shown in
figure~\ref{f:perovskite-structure}, in the case of barium titanate the face
atoms are \ce{O^2-}, the corner atoms are \ce{Ba^2+}, and the centre atoms are
\ce{Ti^4+}. Polarisation in a perovskite occurs when the central cation is
displaced from the centre of the cubic structure\cite{hil00}.

\begin{figure}[ht]

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{PerovskiteStructure}
    \caption{\label{f:perovskite-structure}

        titanate.
    }
\end{figure}

When in a cubic phase perovskites display a paraelectric response because the
electric potential that the central cation experiences becomes very large when
it gets close to the face centred anions and has a minimum in the centre of the
cubic structure, this limits the displacement of the central cation but means it
is most likely to be found at the centre when under no external influence
causing a paraelectric response as shown in figure~\ref{f:bto-room-temp}.
However when the perovskites are in other phases the shape of the lattice
distorts\cite{kwe93} causing two of the face centred anions to sit further from
the centre than the other four, this means that there are two distinct minima in
the electric potential that the centre cation experiences. The centre anion is
equally likely to sit in either of these two spots when there is no external
electric field. When a field is applied to the crystal the centre anion will not
move to the centre of the perovskite structure until an electric field has been
applied in that direction, causing ferroelectric hysteresis as shown
figure~\ref{f:bto-cold}.

Lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate (or PMN-PT) is another type of perovskite
structured ferroelectric, however it does not get its ferroelectricity from
structural changes and is therefore known as a relaxor ferroelectric. Relaxor
ferroelectrics exist in a paraelectric phase at high temperatures but as they
are cooled past the Burns temperature they transition into a ferroelectric
phase. This transition, however, is not accompanied by any structural changes
and is therefore not a structural phase transition\cite{bok06}. Instead the
ferroelectricity of relaxor ferroelectrics is obtained from nano-scale polar
regions which are caused by cations displacing anions\cite{bok92}. While barium
titanate is a relaxor ferroelectric, it also obtains some ferroelectricity from
structural changes\cite{lin77}.

In 1894 Peirre Curie postulated that crystals containing certain molecules could
be magnetised by an electric field (and vice versa). However it wasn't until
1961 that DN Astrov measured an electrically induced magnetisation in
\ce{Cr203}, confirming the magnetoelectric effect. Magnetoelectrics can be
broadly classified into two types, composite magnetoelectrics and intrinsic
magnetoelectrics\cite{kam12}.

Composite magnetoelectrics consist of two different materials, one showing
strong ferroelectricity and the other showing strong ferromagnetism. Since all
ferromagnets display magnetostriction and all ferroelectrics display
piezoelectricity these materials can be coupled via their strain coefficients.
Applying an electric field strains the ferroelectric crystal in some direction
which in turn strains the ferromagnetic crystal, changing its magnetic
properties and in some cases switching the magnetisation. For composite
magnetoelectrics to display a strong magnetoelectric coupling the ferroelectric
material must display large piezoelectric properties, one such material being
lead zirconate titanate (PZT). PZT has fourteen different polarisation
directions allowing the domains to orientate optimally, leading to large
piezoelectric constants and coupling factors\cite{ran98}. This coupled with
PZT's ferroelasticity\cite{meh90} makes it a very good candidate for composite
magnetoelectric materials.

Intrinsic magnetoelectrics, on the other hand, are a single phase crystal
meaning they consist of only one material displaying both ferroelectric and
ferromagnetic properties\cite{kam12}. One significant group of
intrinsic magnetoelectrics are the hexaferrites, so called because they grow
into hexagonal crystals\cite{pul12}. Hexaferrites obtain their
magnetoelectricity from helical spin structures, the ferroelectricity being
supplied by the spin current and the ferromagnetism being caused by deformations
of these structures\cite{kim05,kit10}.

\section{Review}
The first ferroelectric measurements to be performed with an entirely electronic
device were made by CB Sawyer and CH Tower in 1929\cite{saw30}. Sawyer and Tower
used a Braun tube oscilloscope connected to a circuit similar to the
Sawyer-Tower circuit outlined in section~\ref{s:tester}. However the circuit
used potential dividers to bring the voltage down to one manageable by the
oscilloscope. Sawyer and Tower examined how the piezoelectricity of Rochelle
salt was coupled to the ferroelectricity by comparing hysteresis curves of the
sample when clamped by two aluminium plates (to prevent structural changes due
to piezoelectricity) to hysteresis curves of the sample when allowed to stretch
and strain. They found that by clamping the sample they significantly reduced
the amount of charge that could be built up on the sample, and therefore
changing the hysteresis loop significantly. They then went on to examine how the
ferroelectricity was affected by temperature by examining how the shape of the
hysteresis loop changed as the sample was cooled. They found that the voltage
required to obtain saturation and the remanent polarisation were both increased
as the sample cooled below room temperature.

The circuit used by Sawyer and Tower does not differ significantly from the
circuits in use today, however there are two significant differences which
likely affected the quality of the hysteresis curves obtained. Firstly the
circuit contained three resistors, this causes the capacitors used to have a
non-zero time constant and therefore there is a lag when the capacitor
discharges which can easily be mistaken for false hysteresis and makes it
impossible to correctly quantify the hysteresis. Secondly the charge value was
not adjusted for the value of the linear capacitor meaning that the true value
of polarisation was not deduced.

Nowadays magnetoelectric measurements are performed by one of two methods. The
first is a charge amplifier method, this is similar to the ferroelectric methods
used by Sawyer and Tower and is described in section~\ref{s:tester}. This method
was used in 2003\cite{nan03} to determine the magnetoelectric properties of a
composite magnetoelectric made up of magnetostrictive Terfenol-D (a
\ce{Tb}-\ce{Dy}-\ce{Fe} alloy) coupled with lead zirconate titanate. The sample
was poled along one axis using a DC magnetic field of \SI{0.3}{\tesla} an AC
magnetic field of \SI{0.2}{\milli\tesla} was then applied to the sample at
\SI{100}{\hertz}. Electrodes were placed on opposite sides of the sample and it
was placed in a circuit like the one in figure~\ref{f:electrometer-circuit}
except the signal generator was bypassed to ground and the voltage at \(X\) was
not measured. The magnetoelectric effect was then quantified by differentiating
the \(E\)-\(H\) hysteresis loop, this was performed with the electrodes in
various different orientations compared to the magnetic field. They defined the
magnetoelectric coefficient \(\alpha_E\) as in
(\ref{e:magnetoelectric-coefficient}) where \(a\) and \(b\) refer to axes of the
unit cell.

\begin{equation}\label{e:magnetoelectric-coefficient}
    \alpha_{Eab} = \frac{\mathrm{d}E_a}{\mathrm{d}H_b}
\end{equation}

They found that the magnetoelectric coefficient of the sample depended
non-linearly on the bias field applied indicating a ferroic coupling between the
magnetostrictive phase and the piezoelectric phase. They concluded that this was
possible due to the significantly large magnetostriction and piezoelectricity of
the Terfenol-D and PZT respectively.

The second technique makes use of a lock-in amplifier to ensure that only the
polarisation caused by a magnetic field is measured. This technique was used to
quantify a magnetoelectric sample in reference~\cite{zha06}, though the lock-in
was also used to measure a phase difference in the polarisation. In this
experiment an electromagnet was used to apply a \SI{50}{\milli\tesla} DC
magnetic field along one axis of the sample which was wrapped in a solenoid. The
reference signal of the lock-in amplifier was used to drive a small AC magnetic
field in the solenoid and the voltage due to polarisation of the sample was
measured using the signal input of the lock-in amplifier. They found that the
phase shift between the applied magnetic field and the induced electric field
was non-zero only when the magnetic field was oscillated at the samples resonant
frequency.

A PZNT-Metglas composite magnetoelectric was quantified using a third technique
in 2011\cite{par11}. In this setup an electromagnet was used to apply a DC
magnetic field to the sample of \SI{6.3}{\milli\tesla}. A pair of Helmholtz
coils were used to to provide a \SI{1}{\kilo\hertz} AC magnetic field \(H_{AC}\)
of amplitude \SI{0.1}{\milli\tesla}. The polarisation \(P\) was measured using a
circuit similar to the one in figure~\ref{f:saw-tow-circuit} but with the signal
generator bypassed to ground and no voltage measured at \(X\). The polarisation
was plotted against the applied AC magnetic field measured while the DC magnetic
field had been applied. They also found that the two quantities had a small
phase shift of about \SI{53}{\micro\second} which they attributed to losses
caused by the interface between the two phases. They went on to examine the
dependence of this phase shift on frequency of the driving magnetic field,
finding that the phase shift increases as the frequency does which was explained
by the diffusion of charge in the ferroelectric phase\cite{pos69}. They then
tested the maximum polarisation as a function of the amplitude of \(H_{AC}\)
finding that the maximum polarisation increased linearly with the amplitude.
Finally they showed that the maximum polarisation followed the same dependence
on \(H_{DC}\) as the magnetoelectric coefficient
(\(\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}H}\)) did.

In 2010 Y Kitagawa \textit{et al.} reported a low field magnetoelectric effect
at room temperature in \ce{Sr3Co2Fe24O41} (a Z-type hexaferrite) ceramics
sintered in oxygen. They characterised the magnetoelectric effect by measuring
the magnetoelectric current and inferring other properties from that. They first
poled the sample with a \SI{1.5}{\tesla} magnetic field and applied a
\SI{700}{\kilo\volt\per\metre} electric field perpendicular to the magnetic
field, they then reduced the magnetic field to \SI{0.5}{\tesla} and removed the
electric field. These steps were used to put the sample into a paraelectric
ferrimagnetic phase. The magnetoelectric current was then measured by sweeping
the magnetic field from \SI{+0.5}{\tesla} to \SI{-0.5}{\tesla} while measuring
the current from the sample using an electrometer. The polarisation was
calculated from the magnetoelectric current by integrating over time.

They found that there was no spontaneous polarisation at zero magnetic field but
the polarisation increased as the magnetic field did, showing that the sample
was paraelectric in nature. However they found that the polarisation peaked at
\SI{0.2}{\tesla} and then started to reduce to zero, a behaviour not often
associated with paraelectric samples. They then went on to show that though the
sample was not ferroelectric in nature, it still retained information on it's
previous polarisation state. They did this by poling the sample with either a
positive or negative electric field, removing this field, then applying a
positive alternating magnetic field. When they did this they found that,
although there was no net polarisation at zero magnetic field, the polarisation
was induced positively when poled positively or negatively when poled
negatively.

        x-input of an oscilloscope while the voltage at \(Y\) is sent to the
        y-input.
    }
\end{figure}

The most basic form of ferroelectric tester (the Sawyer-Tower
circuit\cite{saw30}) is shown in figure~\ref{f:saw-tow-circuit}. The circuit is
driven by an alternating voltage (this is usually a triangle wave so that the
points on the hysteresis graph are equally spaced) which is also sent to the
x-input of an oscilloscope. From Kirchhoff's Current Law the current at every
point in the circuit is equal meaning that both the test capacitor \(C_T\) and
the sense capacitor \(C_S\) will have the same charge \(Q\) built up on them at
any given time. The charge on a capacitor is given by (\ref{e:qcv}) so the charge
on the test capacitor \(Q_T\) can be measured by measuring the voltage across
the sense capacitor \(V_S\) and applying (\ref{e:qcvcv}).
When this voltage is sent to the y-input of the oscilloscope a hysteresis loop
is generated where the x-axis is the voltage applied to the test capacitor and
the y-axis is equal to \(\frac{Q_T}{C_S}\).

\begin{equation}\label{e:qcv}
    Q = C V
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{e:qcvcv}
    Q_T = C_T V_T = C_S V_S = Q_S
\end{equation}

This setup is simply a voltage divider so the voltage sent to the x-input is not
actually the voltage applied to the test capacitor, it is actually the total
voltage applied to the circuit. For this reason the voltage drop across the
sense capacitor must be negligible compared to the voltage drop across the test
capacitor. This is achieved by using a sense capacitor with a capacitance much
greater than the capacitance of the test capacitor. However if the sense
capacitor is too large then the measured voltage will be small causing a low
signal-to-noise ratio. The literature suggests that the sense capacitor should
be about 10 times larger than the test capacitor.

An alternative ferroelectric tester circuit based on an electrometer is shown in
figure~\ref{f:electrometer-circuit}. This can be thought to operate in the same
manner as the circuit in figure~\ref{f:saw-tow-circuit}, in fact when the
resistor \(R\) is sufficiently large there is a negligible current lost to it and
the two circuits become equivalent. Another way to understand the circuit in
figure~\ref{f:electrometer-circuit} is by viewing it as a transimpedance
amplifier integrating over the current leaving the test capacitor (which due to
Kirchhoff's Current Law is equal to the current entering the test capacitor) and
therefore measuring the charge built up on the capacitor. From (\ref{e:qcv})
the polarisation of the sample can be deduced.

These circuits are designed to measure the polarisation of a ferroelectric
sample that is being driven by an alternating voltage. However by bypassing the
signal generator and instead connecting the sample to ground, the spontaneous
change in polarisation (caused by external stimuli such as stress) can be
measured. This works because ground can act both as a source and sink for charge
so as the polarisation changes charge can freely flow onto or off of the sample
to maintain a net zero field within the sample. This causes charge to flow onto
or off of the sense capacitor which induces a voltage across it of
\(V_S = \frac{Q_T}{C_S}\).

\subsection{Measurements}\label{s:measurements}
There are several measurements that can be used to observe and quantify the
magnetoelectric effect.

Magnetoelectric coupling hysteresis can be performed by applying an alternating
magnetic field to the sample while measuring the induced polarisation. The
magnetic field can be applied by supplying a known alternating current to an
electromagnet, since the magnetic field is linearly proportional to the current
the magnetic field can also be known. The polarisation of the sample can then be
measured using the devices and techniques outlined in section~\ref{s:tester},
with the signal generator bypassed to ground. If the polarisation of some sample
is affected by applying a magnetic field then there must exist some level of
coupling between the magnetic and electric components of the material. From
Maxwell's Equations it is known that a changing magnetic field will induce a
constant potential difference in a circuit, this can manifest itself as an
offset on a \(P\)-\(H\) loop which is easily checked by examining the dependence
of the offset on the rate of change of the magnetic field.

Another test which can be performed is to pole the sample with a positive
magnetic field and perform an electric hysteresis (\(P\)-\(V\)) loop then pole
the sample with a negative magnetic field and perform an electric hysteresis
loop. These two loops can be compared to see how the magnetic field affects the
polarisation of the sample. This measurement can also be performed by poling
with an electric field and sweeping a magnetic field. This measurement is useful
to understand how the performance of the sample changes under certain
conditions.

Another measurement can be made which makes use of a lock-in amplifier,
significantly increasing signal to noise ratio and allowing a very small
magnetoelectric effect to be measured. In this technique a small AC voltage is
used as the reference to a lock-in amplifier and is also used to drive a
Helmholtz coil. The Helmholtz coil applies a small AC magnetic field to the
sample, inducing a small AC voltage between the electrodes on the sample which
is used as the signal for the lock-in. An electromagnet used to apply a large
magnetic field to the sample which is then swept in a low frequency loop
allowing a hysteresis loop to be measured.

When a sample is polarised charge builds up on the electrodes to cancel the
internal electric field caused by the polarisation so that there is a net zero
electric field. When the polarisation is changed the electric field becomes
non-zero, causing a current to flow. When the polarisation is changed by
applying a magnetic field, this is known as the magnetoelectric current. The
magnetoelectric current is a direct consequence of the coupling between the
electric and magnetic components of the sample and is often characteristic of
the sample material. In certain samples the magnetoelectric current will be
negligibly large when the sample is poled and swept along a single axis, this is
common in samples which are strain coupled as the axis will only strain
positively regardless of whether the field is positive or negative. In these
cases the sample can be poled with a magnetic field, then the field can be
reduced to zero after which the sample can be rotated 90 degrees and the field
swept in one direction. This causes the axis along which the current is measured
to be strained negatively at first then positively which can lead to a larger
change in the polarisation and therefore a larger magnetoelectric current.

\section{Objectives}
The initial aim of this project is to design a circuit capable of detecting the
presence of ferroelectric hysteresis. This will be done using a technique
similar to a Sawyer-Tower circuit, although possibly using an electrometer based
design, which was explained previously. Once this has been done the device will
be used to make characteristic measurements on several samples that have been
acquired.

The first step in testing would be to take hysteresis loops of linear
capacitors. Since many modern linear capacitors are actually compensated
non-linear capacitors care must be taken to find truly linear capacitors, such
as ones made using biaxially-oriented polyethylene terephthalate film (commonly
known as PET or Mylar capacitors). By rearranging (\ref{e:qcvcv}) it can be seen
that the hysteresis loops of these capacitors should show up as straight lines
with the gradient \(\frac{C_T}{C_S}\), which can be checked using a multimeter
to measure \(C_T\) and \(C_S\). This method could also be used to calibrate the
device by seeing what the percentage error is on a range of differently valued
linear capacitors.

Another interesting avenue to explore would be using the device to examine
common non-linear circuit elements, such as piezoelectric buzzers, or complex
circuits containing linear components which might give the appearance of
containing non-linear components, such as a resistor and capacitor (which would
cause the capacitor to have a non-zero discharge time). These situations may
come up when performing measurements later in the year so it would be useful to
be able to recognise and characterise the effects.

A ferroelectric barium titanate sample has been procured which has a low
switching voltage (\SI{40}{\volt}), this will be primarily used to test the
operation of the device. However barium titanate has some interesting
temperature dependent properties itself, at temperatures of about
\SI{400}{\kelvin} or higher it is in a cubic paraelectric phase but as it cools
it passes through 3 distinct ferroelectric phases\cite{kwe93,hay02,ish97}.
Liquid nitrogen can be used to cool the sample so that the dependence of
hysteresis on the temperature can be examined. Unfortunately, due to the large
temperature gradient between liquid nitrogen and the surrounding environment, it
is difficult to control the temperature of the sample with liquid nitrogen. On
method to remedy this would be to constantly measure the temperature of the
sample and take a hysteresis loop at certain temperatures, an issue arises here
in that the temperature will likely be changing quickly and therefore the error
on temperature will be large and if the sample is very sensitive to temperature
the hysteresis loop may be significantly distorted. Another method would be to
use a device that is specifically designed to control temperatures, such as a
Peltier cooler, allowing the temperature of the device to be set at a constant
temperature. The disadvantage of this would be that the temperature range is
often limited on devices like these and therefore only a limited section of
temperature dependence could be examined.

There is also a ferroelectric lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate (PMN-PT)
sample available which has a higher switching voltage (\SI{150}{\volt}), this
will be useful for testing the device at the high voltages which might be needed
when performing measurements on later samples. PMN-PT also has a very large
piezoelectric response\cite{nag00} which means that it might have a strong
frequency dependence, causing the hysteresis loop to change with frequency and
maybe even causing complex hysteresis shapes (such as wasp-waisted or reflective
hysteresis).

The first magnetoelectric sample to be tested will be a composite
magnetoelectric of lead zirconate titanate. This sample is suspected to have a
high switching voltage so will require the device to handle high
(\SI{200}{\volt}) voltages if it is to be driven with electric fields. If the
device is not capable of handling voltages this high it may be possible to drive
it only with magnetic fields. This sample will undergo all measurements
described in section~\ref{s:measurements}. First the sample will be poled with a
various strengths and orientations of magnetic field and the electric hysteresis
loops in each of these cases will be compared, this should confirm that the
sample does have some magnetoelectric dependence. Then a magnetic field will be
used to drive electric hysteresis, this may not be possible if the
magnetoelectric coupling is weak or the magnetic material is not piezomagnetic.
And finally the magnetoelectric current will be found, giving a measure of the
magnetoelectric coupling.

The final samples that will be tested are hexaferrite samples, being grown by
pulsed laser deposition at the University of York. These samples are intrinsic
magnetoelectric samples and will undergo the same procedures as the lead
zirconate titanate samples.
